Each sketch contains a description on top of the main file, and the code is commented.
With few exceptions, most of the demonstrated functionality is kept in kept in separate tabs, so it is easier to copy onto other sketches.

The sketches are organized into folders:
+ **Basic** - contains examples for a single functionality, which are easier to extend and combine
+ **Utility** - contains examples which can be useful for testing or improving the behaviour your sketch 
+ **Basic** - contains examples combining different functionalities, as starting points for bigger sketches 

The basic examples include objects and methods to:
+ make a **phonecall**
+ send and receive **SMS**
+ list **contacts** and **installed apps**
+ list **WiFi networks** and **Bluetooth devices**
+ **play audio** from a file or a synthesized audio wave
+ convert **text to speech** and **speech to text**
+ show the user's **location** on a **simple map**

Have fun exploring, extending and combining!
