# processing-androidExamples
A collection of examples for Processing Android mode, some of which use the [Ketai library](https://github.com/ketai/ketai).

Each sketch contains a description on top of the main file, and the code is commented.
With few exceptions, most of the demonstrated functionality is kept in kept in separate tabs, so it is easier to copy onto other sketches.

The sketches are organized into folders:
+ **Basic** - contains examples for a single functionality, which are easier to extend and combine
+ **Utilities** - contains examples which can be useful for testing or improving your sketch 
+ **Basic** - contains examples combining different functionalities, as starting points for bigger sketches 

The basic examples include objects and methods to:
* make a phonecall
* send and receive SMS
* list contacts and installed apps
* list WiFi networks and Bluetooth devices
* play audio from a file or a synthesized audio wave
* convert text to speech and speech to text
* show the user's location on a simple map

Have fun exploring, extending and combining!
